# CSS-playground
A dump of my small-scale CSS exercises and experiments. 
Basically just things I found cool and wanted to try and replicate.

<b>Page 1:</b> 
* A fancy "metallic" hover glow effect
* Only the currently hovered card shows the glow
* All the cards' edges glow according to the mouse position
* CSS pseudo-elements used for multiple layers; JS used to track mouse position

<b>Page 2:</b> 
* A smooth scrolling picture gallery with a parallax effect
* Click and drag
* The gallery is automatically generated from given pictures using JS
* The smooth scrolling is made using JS Animate method

<b>Page 3:</b> 
* A fancy color-changing spotlight on mouse position
* A rotating ellipse with a counter-rotating gradient fill with a lot of blur
* JS used to animate the rotations and track the mouse position
